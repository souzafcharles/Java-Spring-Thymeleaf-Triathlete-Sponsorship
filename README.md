# üèäüö¥üèÉ Triathlete Sponsorship Management Web

***
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Project developed based on tutorials by **Gilberto
** - [4CatsDev](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8jbyWxdQ-n-WuVOeqqVTXZEhml3H_bH).
***

## System Overview:

<p align="justify">
The Triathlete Sponsorship Management Web is designed to manage the sponsorship relationships between triathletes and sponsors. Each Triathlete can have multiple Sponsors, and each Sponsor can support multiple Triathletes, forming a <code>Many-to-Many</code> (M:N) relationship.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To efficiently manage this relationship, an intermediate table (<code>tb_triathlete_sponsor</code>) is created, ensuring a structured connection between Triathletes and Sponsors. This <code>Many-to-Many</code> relationship is a core aspect of the system's design. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The system aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing these interactions, streamlining the sponsorship process for both triathletes and sponsors. The development of this system leverages the capabilities of the <code>Java Spring</code> framework, incorporating key technologies such as <code>Spring Boot</code>, <code>Spring Data JPA</code>, and <code>PostgreSQL</code>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The user interface is built using <code>Thymeleaf</code> templates, incorporating <code>Bootstrap 5.1.3</code> for responsive design and styling, and <code>jQuery 3.6.1</code> for enhanced client-side interactions.
</p>

spring.datasource.url=${DATABASE_URL}
spring.datasource.username=${DATABASE_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
# Hibernate settings
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

***

## Creation of the `.env` File:

- At the root of the project, create a file named `.env` to declare the environment variables required for the
  `PostgreSQL` database connection.

***

## Requirements for LoadEnvironment Class:

- **Class Purpose:**
    - Create the `LoadEnvironment` class to load environment variables from a `.env` file and set them as system
      properties.

- **Load Environment Method:**
    - **Method:** `loadEnv`
    - **Purpose:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file and sets them as system properties.
    - **Implementation Details:**
        - Use the `Dotenv.configure().load()` method from the `io.github.cdimascio.dotenv` library to load the
          environment variables.
        - Iterate over the entries using
          `dotenv.entries().forEach(entry -> System.setProperty(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()))` to set each
          environment variable as a system property.

- **External Library:**
    - **Library:** `io.github.cdimascio.dotenv`
    - **Purpose:** Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file. Ensure this library is included as a
      dependency in your project's build configuration.

- **Purpose:**
    - Ensure that environment variables defined in a `.env` file are loaded and accessible as system properties
      throughout the application.

***

## Entry Point Integration:

- Call the environment loader at the project's entry point to ensure environment variables are available at runtime:

```java

@SpringBootApplication
public class TriathleteSponsorshipWebApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LoadEnvironment.loadEnv();
        SpringApplication.run(TriathleteSponsorshipWebApplication.class, args);
    }

}
```

# Backend Requirements Specification:

## Requirements for `Triathlete` Entity Class:

- **Entity Mapping:**
    - Define the `Triathlete` class as an entity to represent a database table;
    - Annotate the class with `@Entity` to designate it as a persistent entity;
    - Use `@Table(name = "tb_triathlete")` to map the entity to the database table named `tb_triathlete`.

- **Attributes and Annotations:**
    - Declare attributes `id`, `name`, `age`, and `sponsors` to represent the respective database columns;
    - Annotate the `id` field with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` to specify it as the
      primary key with an automatically generated value;
    - Use `@NotBlank` and `@Size(min = 2)` on `name` to enforce validation constraints;
    - Apply `@Min(value = 18)` on `age` to ensure a minimum valid age requirement;
    - Establish a many-to-many relationship between `Triathlete` and `Sponsor` using
      `@ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)`;
    - Configure the relationship mapping with `@JoinTable`, specifying `joinColumns` and `inverseJoinColumns`.

- **Accessors and Mutators:**
    - Implement `getters` and `setters` for all attributes to facilitate data manipulation.

- **Serializable Interface:**
    - Ensure the entity implements the `Serializable` interface if object serialisation is required for transmission or
      storage.

- **Database Constraints and Relationships:**
    - Ensure that the `name` column is not blank and has a minimum length;
    - Ensure that the `age` column enforces a minimum valid value;
    - Define a structured association between `Triathlete` and `Sponsor` entities through a join table.

- **Equals and HashCode:**
    - Override the `equals()` method to compare instances based on the `id` attribute;
    - Override `hashCode()` to generate a consistent hash code using `Objects.hashCode(id)`.

***

## Requirements for `TriathleteRepository` Interface:

- **Repository Definition:**
    - Define `TriathleteRepository` as a repository interface to manage `Triathlete` entities;
    - Extend `JpaRepository<Triathlete, Long>` to inherit standard CRUD operations and pagination capabilities.

- **Custom Query Methods:**
    - Declare `List<Triathlete> findByNameContainingIgnoreCase(String name)` to enable case-insensitive search for
      `Triathlete` entities by name.

- **Spring Data JPA Integration:**
    - Leverage Spring Data JPA's query derivation mechanism to generate the query for
      `findByNameContainingIgnoreCase(String name)`, ensuring flexible searching.

- **Entity Association:**
    - Ensure that the repository is correctly associated with the `Triathlete` entity, maintaining consistency with the
      database schema.

- **Code Simplicity and Maintainability:**
    - Utilise the built-in capabilities of `JpaRepository` to reduce boilerplate code and enhance maintainability.

***

## Requirements for `TriathleteService` Class:

- **Service Definition:**
    - Define `TriathleteService` as a service class responsible for business logic related to `Triathlete` entities;
    - Annotate the class with `@Service` to designate it as a Spring-managed service component.

- **Dependency Injection:**
    - Inject `TriathleteRepository` using `@Autowired` to enable interaction with the database.

- **CRUD Operations:**
    - Implement `createTriathlete(Triathlete triathlete)`, which saves a new `Triathlete` entity to the database;
    - Implement `readAllTriathletes()`, which retrieves a list of all registered triathletes;
    - Implement `readTriathleteById(Long id)`, which fetches a `Triathlete` entity by its identifier, throwing
      `TriathleteNotFoundException` if not found;
    - Implement `editTriathlete(Triathlete triathlete)`, which updates an existing triathlete's details;
    - Implement `deleteTriathlete(Long id)`, which first clears the association with sponsors before deleting the
      entity.

- **Custom Query Methods:**
    - Implement `readAllTriathletesByName(String name)`, which retrieves triathletes based on a case-insensitive search
      of their name.

- **Exception Handling:**
    - Ensure `readTriathleteById(Long id)` throws `TriathleteNotFoundException` if the requested entity is not found;
    - Ensure `deleteTriathlete(Long id)` utilises `readTriathleteById(Long id)` to verify existence before proceeding
      with deletion.

- **Data Integrity:**
    - Clear sponsorship associations before deleting a `Triathlete` to maintain referential integrity;
    - Use `triathleteRepository.save(triathlete)` after clearing sponsors to persist the changes before deletion.

- **Business Logic Separation:**
    - Ensure that `TriathleteService` strictly contains business logic, while data access remains in
      `TriathleteRepository`.

- **Code Maintainability:**
    - Leverage `Optional<Triathlete>` to handle nullability and reduce boilerplate code in
      `readTriathleteById(Long id)`;

      `saveTriathlete(Model model, @ModelAttribute("newTriathlete") @Valid Triathlete triathlete, BindingResult errors, RedirectAttributes attributes)`,
      mapped to `@PostMapping("/save")`, to validate and save a new triathlete;
    - Implement `deleteTriathlete(@PathVariable("id") long id, RedirectAttributes attributes)`, mapped to
      `@GetMapping("/delete/{id}")`, to delete a triathlete, handling `TriathleteNotFoundException` if the ID is
      invalid;
    - Implement `editForm(Model model, @PathVariable("id") long id, RedirectAttributes attributes)`, mapped to
      `@GetMapping("/edit/{id}")`, to display the edit form for an existing triathlete;
    - Implement
      `editTriathlete(Model model, @PathVariable("id") long id, @ModelAttribute("objectTriathlete") @Valid Triathlete triathlete, BindingResult errors)`,
      mapped to `@PostMapping("/edit/{id}")`, to validate and update an existing triathlete;
    - Implement `viewForm(Model model, @PathVariable("id") long id, RedirectAttributes attributes)`, mapped to
      `@GetMapping("/view/{id}")`, to display details of a specific triathlete.

- **Exception Handling:**
    - Catch `TriathleteNotFoundException` when attempting to retrieve or delete a non-existent triathlete, redirecting
      with an error message if necessary.

- **Data Integrity and Validation:**

- **Attributes and Annotations:**
    - Define attributes `id`, `title`, and `triathletes` to map to the respective database columns;
    - Annotate the `id` field with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` to enable automatic
      primary key generation;
    - Use `@NotBlank(message = TriathleteSponsorshipMessages.SPONSOR_TITLE_REQUIRED)` to enforce that `title` must not
      be blank;
    - Apply `@Size(min = 2, message = TriathleteSponsorshipMessages.SPONSOR_TITLE_MIN_LENGTH)` to define a minimum
      character length for `title`;
    - Establish a bidirectional many-to-many relationship with `Triathlete` using `@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "sponsors")`.

- **Accessors and Mutators:**
    - Implement `getters` and `setters` for all attributes to facilitate data manipulation.

      ignoring case sensitivity.

- **Spring Data JPA Integration:**
    - Leverage Spring Data JPA to automatically implement common database operations without requiring explicit query
      definitions;
    - Allow dependency injection of `SponsorRepository` into service classes to manage sponsor-related transactions.

- **Code Maintainability:**
    - Ensure that method names follow Spring Data JPA naming conventions to generate queries dynamically;
    - Use `Optional<Sponsor>` to handle potential null values safely when searching for a sponsor by `title`.

***

## Requirements for `SponsorService` Class:

- **Service Definition:**
    - Define the `SponsorService` class as a Spring-managed service using the `@Service` annotation;
    - Inject `SponsorRepository` using `@Autowired` to handle sponsor-related database operations.

- **Sponsor Creation:**

    - Check if a sponsor with the same title already exists using `findByTitleIgnoreCase(String title)`;
    - Throw a `SponsorAlreadyExistsException` if a duplicate sponsor title is found;
    - Save and return the new sponsor entity if it does not exist.

- **Sponsor Retrieval:**
    - Implement the `readAllSponsors()` method to retrieve all sponsors from the database;
    - Use `findAll()` from `JpaRepository` to return a list of all sponsor entities.

- **Exception Handling:**
    - Ensure the application prevents duplicate sponsor entries by validating the sponsor's title before saving;
    - Utilise a custom exception (`SponsorAlreadyExistsException`) to notify when a sponsor with the same title already
      exists.

- **Best Practices:**
    - Follow the Dependency Injection principle to improve testability and maintainability;
    - Use `Optional<Sponsor>` to safely handle the presence or absence of a sponsor in the database.

***

    - Create a new `Sponsor` object and add it to the model with the attribute `"newSponsor"`;
    - Return the view `/new-sponsor` to render the sponsor registration form.

- **Sponsor Saving Process:**
    - Implement the `saveSponsor(Sponsor sponsor, BindingResult errors, RedirectAttributes attributes, Model model)`
      method with `@PostMapping("/save")`;
    - Use `@ModelAttribute("newSponsor")` to bind the submitted form data to a `Sponsor` object;
    - Validate the sponsor input using `@Valid` and `BindingResult` to handle validation errors;
    - If validation errors exist, return to `/new-sponsor` without saving the sponsor;
    - Call `sponsorService.createSponsor(sponsor)` to save the sponsor if no errors occur;
    - Handle `SponsorAlreadyExistsException` by adding an error message to the model and returning `/new-sponsor`;
    - If successful, add a success message using `RedirectAttributes` and redirect to `/sponsor/new`.

- **Exception Handling:**
    - Catch `SponsorAlreadyExistsException` when attempting to create a sponsor with a duplicate title;
    - Display an error message on the form without breaking the user experience.

- **Best Practices:**
    - Use `@RequestMapping("/sponsor")` for better route organisation;
    - Follow Spring MVC conventions by separating concerns between the controller, service, and repository layers;
    - Ensure form validation and proper error handling to improve user experience.

***

## Requirements for `SponsorAlreadyExistsException` Class:

- **Exception Definition:**
    - Define the `SponsorAlreadyExistsException` class to handle cases where a sponsor with the same title already
      exists;
    - Extend the `RuntimeException` class to create an unchecked exception.

    - Implement a constructor that takes a `String title` as a parameter;
    - Call the superclass (`RuntimeException`) constructor with a meaningful error message:  
      `"Sponsor with title: " + title + " already exists"`.

- **Usage in Application:**
    - Throw this exception in the `SponsorService` class when attempting to save a sponsor with a duplicate title;
    - Handle this exception in the `SponsorController` class by displaying an error message to the user.

- **Best Practices:**
    - Ensure that meaningful exception messages are provided to improve debugging and user feedback;
    - Use unchecked exceptions (`RuntimeException`) for business logic validation to avoid excessive boilerplate code.

***

## Requirements for `TriathleteSponsorshipMessages` Utility Class:

- **Purpose and Structure:**

      triathletes and sponsors;
    - Declare the class as `final` to prevent it from being subclassed;
    - Include a private constructor to prevent instantiation, with an exception being thrown (`IllegalStateException`)
      if the constructor is called, ensuring the class adheres to its utility role.

- **Triathlete Messages Constants:**
    - Define constants such as `TRIATHLETE_NAME_REQUIRED`, `TRIATHLETE_NAME_MIN_LENGTH`, `TRIATHLETE_AGE_MIN`, and
      `TRIATHLETE_SAVED_SUCCESSFULLY` to store messages related to triathletes;
    - Ensure each message is meaningful and aligns with the application's user feedback requirements.

- **Sponsor Messages Constants:**
    - Define constants such as `SPONSOR_TITLE_REQUIRED`, `SPONSOR_TITLE_MIN_LENGTH`, and `SPONSOR_SAVED_SUCCESSFULLY` to
      store messages related to sponsors;
    - Ensure these constants are self-explanatory and provide actionable information to the users.

- **Code Organisation:**
    - Group related constants logically under comments (e.g., `// Triathlete Messages` and `// Sponsor Messages`) to
      enhance readability and maintainability;
    - Use consistent naming conventions (`UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`) for all constants, as per Java standards.

- **Immutability:**
    - Declare all constants as `public static final` to ensure they are immutable and can be accessed without
      instantiating the class.

- **Error Handling:**
    - Include a meaningful error message within the private constructor when the class is instantiated improperly to
      guide developers in adhering to its intended usage.

    - The page is designed to display and manage a list of triathletes in a table format using Thymeleaf for dynamic
      content rendering;
    - Ensure the page structure adheres to standard HTML5 guidelines and utilises Bootstrap classes for responsive
      design.

- **Navigation and Actions:**
    - Provide buttons for creating new triathletes and sponsors, linking to the appropriate pages (`@{/new}` and
      `@{/sponsor/new}`);
    - Include a search form allowing users to search for triathletes by name. Add a "Cancel" button to reset the search
      and return to the main page (`@{/}`).

- **Table Design:**
    - Use a `table` element with Bootstrap's `table-striped` class for enhanced readability;
    - Display columns for `Id`, `Name`, `Age`, and action columns for `Delete`, `Edit`, and `View`;
    - Highlight column headers with a distinct background colour and centralised text for clarity.

- **Action Icons:**
    - Include icons for `Delete`, `Edit`, and `View` actions:
        - Use `fa-regular fa-trash-can` for the delete functionality, with a confirmation prompt implemented using
          `th:data-confirm-delete`;
        - Use `fa-regular fa-pen-to-square` for edit links;
        - Use `fa fa-eye` for viewing details.

      object;
    - Display a fallback message in the table (`"No Triathletes found."`) if `listTriathletes` is empty.

- **Error Messages:**
    - Display server-side error messages using a Bootstrap alert component (`alert-danger`);
    - Render the message dynamically using Thymeleaf's `th:if` and `th:text` directives.

- **Styling and Layout:**
    - Use inline styles within the `<style>` block to customise the table, including shadow effects and rounded corners
      for aesthetic appeal;
    - Style table headers and cells for improved readability:
        - Headers (`<th>`) use a blue background (`#007bff`) with white text;
        - Data cells (`<td>`) are centred and formatted for clarity, except `Name`, which is aligned to the left.
